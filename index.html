            Surprising Facts <br />
            About <br />
            the Egyptian Pyramids
          </h3>
          <p class="pyramid-descrip">
            The Egyptian pyramids are one of the defining architectural
            achievements of the ancient world. As an incredible feat of
            engineering, Egyptologists are still discovering more about these
            structures with each passing year. The Giza pyramid complex has
            drawn visitors from around the world since the days of the Grand
            Tour and children around the world who study the mysteries of
            ancient Egypt cant help but associate the pyramids with the grand
            pharaohs of yesteryear.
          </p>
          <p class="pyramid-descrip">
            Still shrouded in mystery, the pyramids dont reveal their secrets
            easily. But over time, scholars have come to learn many surprising
            facts about ancient Egypt through them. Technical prowess mixed with
            mythology and superstition led the pharaohs to construct these
            formidable structures, which have proven to be some of the most
            indestructible
          </p>
          <p class="pyramid-descrip">
            Many examples are found in the vast Saqqara burial ground located in
            what was Ancient Egypts capital, Memphis. The pyramids here are the
            earliest known and include the Pyramid of Djoser. Built during the
            third dynasty and designed by architect Imhotep, it was constructed
            between 2630 BCE and 2611 BCE. Its considered one of the worlds
            oldest monuments made of cut masonry and is not, in fact, pointed.
          </p>
          <p class="pyramid-descrip">
            Ancient Egyptian culture is full of symbolism and superstitions that
            guided decision making. So it should come as no surprise that even
            the location of the ancient pyramids were guided by mythology.
